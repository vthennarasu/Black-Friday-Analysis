# Black-Friday-Analysis

## Our Goals and Aspirations With This Project

A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summaries of various customers for selected high-volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city type, stay in the current city), product details (productid and product category) and Total purchase amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customers against various products which will help them to create a personalized offer for customers against different products.

#### Tasks to perform

- The purchase column is the Target Variable, perform Univariate Analysis and Bivariate Analysis w.r.t the Purchase.

- Masked in the column description means already converted from categorical value to numerical column.
