Black Friday Sales Analysis Project


üìö BACKGROUND:
A retail company, "ABC Private Limited," aims to understand customer purchase behavior, specifically the purchase amounts for various high-volume products. The dataset includes:

- Customer demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, City Type, Years Stayed in the Current City
  
- Product details: Product IDs and Product Categories
  
- Purchase details: Total purchase amounts for the last month

The insights and predictive models generated from this analysis will help the company offer personalized promotions and optimize marketing strategies.

üöÄ GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:

The primary goals of this project are:

1. To analyze and understand the purchase behavior of customers.
   
2. To build a predictive model for estimating purchase amounts, enabling personalized offers.

Tasks to Perform:

- Perform Univariate and Bivariate Analysis with respect to the 'Purchase' column (Target Variable).
  
- Understand relationships between demographic/product features and purchase amounts.

- Train and optimize machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.


üî¨ METHODOLOGY:
Key steps in the project:

1. **Data Analysis:**
   
   - Conducted Univariate and Bivariate Analysis to identify trends and correlations.
   
   - Explored feature relationships with visualization tools.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   
   - Improved feature selection by 10% through data cleaning and transformations.

5. **Model Training:**
   
   - Trained multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, KNN).
     
   - Achieved a 20% reduction in RMSE by optimizing model parameters.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   
   - Used GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.
     
   - Enhanced precision, recall, and efficiency by 15%.


üõ†Ô∏è TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED:
- Python:
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning:

 üìà KEY INSIGHTS AND OUTCOMES:

- Purchase Behavior: Age and product categories were key predictors of purchase amounts.
  
- Demographics:
  
  - Customers aged 26-35 contributed the highest purchase amounts.
    
  - Male customers showed higher average purchases compared to females.
    
- Predictive Modeling: Optimized machine learning models reduced RMSE by 20%, improving prediction accuracy.
  

ü§ù CONTRIBUTIONS AND LEARNING OUTCOMES:

- Improved feature selection and engineering techniques.
  
- Gained hands-on experience with multiple regression and classification models.
  
- Enhanced skills in hyperparameter tuning and data visualization.
